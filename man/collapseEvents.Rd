\title{Collapse events per sample and chromosome}
\usage{
collapseEvents(subset_df, min_ME = 2, min_size = 5e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{subset_df}{A data.frame containing event-level data with columns:
ID: Sample identifier.
seqnames: Chromosome name.
start: Start position of the event.
end: End position of the event.
group: Event group/class.
n_snps: Number of SNPs in the event.
n_mendelian_error: Number of Mendelian errors in the event.
ratio_proband, ratio_mother, ratio_father: (optional) depth-ratio metrics}

\item{min_ME}{Minimum number of Mendelian errors required to retain an event
before collapsing (default: 2).}

\item{min_size}{Minimum genomic span size required to retain an event
before collapsing, in base pairs (default: 500e3).}
}
\value{
A data.frame with collapsed events and columns:
ID, seqnames, group
n_events: Number of events collapsed
total_mendelian_error: Sum of Mendelian errors across events
total_size: Total genomic span size covered by events
collapsed_events: Comma-separated list of collapsed events
min_start, max_end: Genomic span of collapsed block
total_snps: Total SNPs in the overlapping events
prop_covered: Proportion of the region covered by events
ratio_proband, ratio_mother, ratio_father: Weighted mean ratios across the collapsed events,
calculated as \(\sum_i r_i \cdot N_i / \sum_i N_i\), where \(r_i\) is the ratio of each
individual event and \(N_i\) is the number of SNPs in that event. Returned only if
the input contains all three ratio columns
}
\description{
This function collapses genomic events per individual, chromosome, and group,
summarising the number of events, total Mendelian errors, the total span size,
and a string listing all merged event coordinates.
