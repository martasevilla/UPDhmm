\title{Collapse contiguous variants with the same state into blocks}
\usage{
blocksVcf(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame resulting from the \code{as_df_vcf} function.}
}
\value{
data.frame containing one row per block
}
\description{
This function takes a data.frame produced by \code{asDfVcf} and
identifies contiguous variants that share the same inferred state (\code{group}).
These contiguous variants are then merged into "blocks", summarizing their start
and end positions, number of variants, genotype codings, and optionally
summed quality/depth metrics.
