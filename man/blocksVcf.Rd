\title{Collapse contiguous variants with the same inferred state into blocks}
\usage{
blocksVcf(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame produced by \code{asDfVcf()}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row per block. Columns include:
\itemize{
\item ID – sample identifier
\item seqnames, start, end – genomic coordinates
\item group – inferred state of the block
\item n_snps – number of variants in the block
\item geno_coded – list of numeric genotype codes per block
\item summed and counted quality/depth metrics per block (if present)
}
}
\description{
This function identifies consecutive variants in a data.frame
(produced by \code{asDfVcf()}) that share the same inferred state
and merges them into contiguous "blocks". Each block summarizes its start
and end positions, the number of variants it contains, genotype codings, and
optionally summed quality or depth metrics if the columns exist in the input.
